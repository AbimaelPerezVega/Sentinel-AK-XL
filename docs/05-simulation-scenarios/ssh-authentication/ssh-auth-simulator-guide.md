# SSH Authentication Simulation Guide

## Overview

The SSH Authentication Simulator generates realistic SSH authentication failure logs for SOC training and dashboard testing. It creates diverse attack patterns with proper GeoIP data for your Wazuh â†’ ELK pipeline.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Copy Script to Container
```bash
# Copy simulator to Wazuh manager container
docker cp scenarios-simulator/ssh-auth/ssh-auth-simulator.sh \
  sentinel-wazuh-manager:/usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator

# Make executable
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator
```

### 2. Create Test Directory
```bash
# Create test log directory (should already exist from installation)
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager mkdir -p /var/ossec/logs/test

# Verify permissions
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager ls -la /var/ossec/logs/test/
```

## Basic Usage

### Test with Dry Run
```bash
# See what events would be generated without creating them
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator --dry-run -n 5
```

### Generate Basic Authentication Failures
```bash
# Generate 25 mixed authentication failures
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator -n 25 -v

# Use custom log file location
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator \
  -l /var/ossec/logs/test/sshd.log -n 50 -v
```

## Attack Patterns for SOC Training

### Pattern 1: Fast Brute Force (High Priority Alert)
```bash
# Generates rapid attempts from single IP - should trigger alerts quickly
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator \
  -p fast_brute -n 15 -d 1-3 -v

# Expected: High frequency spikes, single IP concentration, root account targeting
```

### Pattern 2: Distributed Attack (APT Simulation)
```bash
# Coordinated attack from multiple IPs across different countries
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator \
  -p distributed -n 20 -v

# Expected: Multiple source countries, coordinated timing, admin account focus
```

### Pattern 3: Credential Spray (Stealth Attack)
```bash
# Many users, slower pace to avoid detection thresholds
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator \
  -p credential_spray -n 30 -d 5-15 -v

# Expected: Wide username distribution, lower frequency per account
```

### Pattern 4: Targeted Attack (High-Value Accounts)
```bash
# Focus on privileged accounts (root, admin, oracle, postgres)
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator \
  -p targeted_attack -n 12 -v

# Expected: Privileged account targeting, persistent attempts
```

### Pattern 5: Slow Brute Force (Under the Radar)
```bash
# Low and slow approach to avoid detection
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator \
  -p slow_brute -n 20 -d 10-30 -v

# Expected: Extended timeline, harder to detect patterns
```

## Continuous Monitoring Simulation

### Background Service Mode
```bash
# Run continuous simulation (stop with Ctrl+C or container restart)
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator \
  -c -p mixed -d 30-300 -v
```

### Scheduled Attack Simulation
```bash
# Run simulation in background for extended testing
docker exec -d sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator \
  -p mixed -n 100 -d 5-20

# Check if running
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager ps aux | grep ssh-auth-simulator
```

## Geographic Distribution

The simulator uses 25 source IPs from various countries for realistic GeoIP analysis:

### High-Risk Regions
- **China** (103.124.106.4) - Known for brute force campaigns
- **Russia** (185.220.101.45) - TOR exit nodes, state actors
- **Ukraine** (194.147.32.101) - Compromised infrastructure

### Cloud/VPN Providers
- **Germany** (167.99.164.201) - DigitalOcean hosting
- **Netherlands** (92.63.197.153) - VPN services
- **UK** (46.101.230.157) - Cloud hosting
- **Singapore** (159.65.153.147) - Cloud services

### Other Regions
- **US** (198.211.99.118) - Suspicious activity
- **Canada** (161.35.70.249) - Cloud hosting
- **Japan** (142.93.222.179) - VPS providers

## Verification Commands

### Check Generated Authentication Logs
```bash
# View recent SSH simulation events
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager tail -f /var/log/auth.log

# Count total events generated  
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | wc -l

# View simulation-specific logs
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager tail -f /var/log/ssh-auth-simulation.log
```

### Verify Wazuh Processing
```bash
# Check for SSH authentication failure alerts (Rule 5716)
curl -s "localhost:9200/wazuh-alerts-*/_search?q=rule.id:5716&size=5&sort=@timestamp:desc" | \
  jq '.hits.hits[]._source | {timestamp: .timestamp, srcip: .data.srcip, user: .data.srcuser}'

# Check for multiple authentication failures (Rule 5720)
curl -s "localhost:9200/wazuh-alerts-*/_search?q=rule.id:5720&size=5&sort=@timestamp:desc" | \
  jq '.hits.hits[]._source | {timestamp: .timestamp, description: .rule.description}'
```

### Monitor GeoIP Enrichment
```bash
# Verify geographic enrichment in processed logs
curl -s "localhost:9200/sentinel-logs-*/_search" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "query": {"match": {"full_log": "Failed password"}},
    "size": 3,
    "_source": ["data.srcip", "geoip.country_name", "geoip.city_name", "@timestamp"]
  }' | jq '.hits.hits[]._source'
```

## Expected Wazuh Rules Triggered

### Rule 5716: SSH Authentication Failure
- **Level**: 5
- **Description**: SSH authentication failure
- **Trigger**: Each failed login attempt

### Rule 5720: Multiple SSH Authentication Failures  
- **Level**: 10
- **Description**: Multiple authentication failures
- **Trigger**: Multiple failures from same source

### Custom Rules (if configured)

docker exec -d sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator \
  -n 100 -p mixed -c

# Let run for 30 minutes, then stop with:
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager pkill -f ssh-auth-simulator

# Student Task: Hunt for anomalies in authentication logs
# Expected Finding: Various attack techniques, baseline establishment
```

## Dashboard Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Base Dataset
```bash
# Create initial dataset for dashboard development
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator \
  -n 50 -p mixed -v

# Wait 2-3 minutes for processing
sleep 180

# Verify events in Elasticsearch
curl -s "localhost:9200/sentinel-logs-*/_search?q=Failed%20password&size=0" | jq '.hits.total'
```

### Step 2: Generate Pattern-Specific Data
```bash
# Fast brute force data
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator \
  -p fast_brute -n 15 -d 1-2 -v

# Credential spray data
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator \
  -p credential_spray -n 25 -d 3-8 -v

# Distributed attack data
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator \
  -p distributed -n 20 -d 2-6 -v
```

## Cleanup and Management

### Stop Running Simulations
```bash
# Find and stop any running SSH simulators
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager pkill -f ssh-auth-simulator

# Verify no processes running
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager ps aux | grep ssh-auth-simulator
```

### Clear Simulation Logs
```bash
# Clear SSH simulation logs (keep system auth.log intact)
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager : > /var/log/ssh-auth-simulation.log

# Clear custom test log if used
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager : > /var/ossec/logs/test/sshd.log
```

### View Simulation Statistics
```bash
# Check simulation log for statistics
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager cat /var/log/ssh-auth-simulation.log

# Count events by attack pattern
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager grep -c "FAST_BRUTE\|DISTRIBUTED\|CRED_SPRAY" /var/log/ssh-auth-simulation.log
```

## Troubleshooting

### No SSH Alerts Appearing
```bash
# Check if Wazuh is monitoring auth.log
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager grep -A 5 -B 5 "auth.log" /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf

# Verify log file permissions
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager ls -la /var/log/auth.log

# Ensure Wazuh can read auth.log
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager chmod 644 /var/log/auth.log
```

### Events Not Enriched with GeoIP
```bash
# Check Logstash GeoIP processing
curl -s "localhost:9600/_node/pipelines?pretty" | grep -A 10 -B 10 geoip

# Verify Logstash is processing auth logs
docker logs sentinel-logstash | grep -i geoip
```

### Wrong Timestamp Issues
```bash
# Verify system time in container
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager date

# Check log timestamps format
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager tail -5 /var/log/auth.log
```

### Script Permission Errors
```bash
# Re-apply executable permissions
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator

# Check script location
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager ls -la /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator
```

## Expected Dashboard Metrics

After generating 100+ events, your authentication dashboard should display:

### Geographic Distribution
- **Top Countries**: China, Russia, Netherlands, Germany, US
- **Heat Map**: Concentrated activity in high-risk regions
- **ISP Analysis**: Cloud providers, hosting services, VPN endpoints

### Attack Pattern Analysis
- **Brute Force**: 10-15 rapid attempts per source IP
- **Credential Spray**: 1-3 attempts per username across many accounts
- **Targeted Attacks**: Focus on admin, root, oracle, postgres accounts

### Temporal Analysis
- **Attack Duration**: Fast brute (minutes), distributed (hours), slow brute (days)
- **Peak Activity**: Varies by pattern and configuration
- **Frequency Distribution**: Mixed patterns create realistic baseline noise

## Integration with SOC Pipeline

### End-to-End Verification
```bash
# Generate test event with unique identifier
TOKEN=$(date +%s)
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager bash -c "
echo 'Sep 04 $(date +%H:%M:%S) sentinel-test sshd[9999]: Failed password for testuser$TOKEN from 8.8.8.8 port 22 ssh2' >> /var/log/auth.log
"

# Wait for processing (60 seconds)
sleep 60

# Search for the test token in Elasticsearch
curl -s "localhost:9200/sentinel-logs-*/_search?q=testuser$TOKEN" | jq '.hits.total'
```

### Expected Processing Flow
1. **Wazuh Manager** â†’ Processes auth.log changes via syscheck
2. **Rule Engine** â†’ Applies SSH authentication rules (5716, 5720)
3. **Filebeat** â†’ Ships alerts to Logstash for enrichment
4. **Logstash** â†’ Adds GeoIP data and sends to Elasticsearch
5. **Elasticsearch** â†’ Indexes as `sentinel-logs-*` pattern
6. **Kibana** â†’ Visualizes geographic and temporal attack patterns

### Wazuh Rules Integration
- **Rule 5710**: Multiple authentication failures (base rule)
- **Rule 5716**: SSH authentication failure (individual events)
- **Rule 5720**: Multiple SSH authentication failures (correlation)
- **Custom Rules**: Geographic filtering, rapid attempt detection

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Attack Scenarios
```bash
# Simulate APT-style slow burn attack
docker exec -d sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator \
  -p slow_brute -c -d 300-1800  # 5-30 minute delays

# Simulate weekend attack campaign
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator \
  -p distributed -n 50 -d 10-60 -v
```

### Combining with Network Simulation
```bash
# Run SSH attacks followed by network reconnaissance
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator \
  -p fast_brute -n 20 -v

# Wait 5 minutes, then simulate network scan from same geographic region
sleep 300
docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/network-activity-simulator \
  -p portscan_fast -n 3 -v
```

### Testing Detection Thresholds
```bash
# Test detection threshold tuning
for i in {1..5}; do
  docker exec -it sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator \
    -p fast_brute -n $((i*5)) -d 1-2 -v
  sleep 120  # Wait between batches
done
```

This simulation provides realistic SSH authentication attack scenarios essential for SOC analyst training and system validation. The generated data creates a foundation for building comprehensive authentication monitoring dashboards and response procedures.
