# Sentinel SOC AK-XL: Dashboard & Visualization Guide

Welcome to the Sentinel SOC AK-XL project. This document provides a detailed overview of the four custom Kibana dashboards built to monitor, analyze, and respond to security events. Each section explains the purpose of a dashboard and its individual visualizations.

### 1. Enhanced Network Analysis üìà
This dashboard focuses on analyzing network traffic to detect suspicious activities like port scanning and identify traffic patterns.

* **Port-scan Heatmap (SrcIP √ó DstPort):** A heatmap displaying source IPs and destination ports to visualize scanning patterns across multiple hosts and services at once.
* **Top destination ports targeted:** A bar chart of the most targeted destination ports, helping to detect interest in specific services (e.g., SSH, RDP, web servers).
* **Distinct ports over time (by src IP):** A line chart showing the number of unique ports targeted over time. It is useful for detecting both rapid scanning bursts and slow, stealthy scans.
* **Targeted Hosts:** A heatmap that identifies the most frequently scanned internal assets, highlighting which systems are under the most scrutiny from potential attackers.
* **Possible Port Scanners (last 15m):** A table listing source IPs that have contacted the highest number of unique destination ports, suggesting active scanning behavior.
* **Connections by protocol & action:** A heatmap that breaks down traffic volume by protocol (TCP/UDP) and firewall action (e.g., DROP/ALLOW), useful for validating firewall rules.
* **Source IPs by Country:** A geographic map displaying the distribution of source IPs to identify the origins of suspicious traffic.
* **Top Source IPs:** A bar chart of the most active source IPs, helping to spot repeat offenders or brute-force sources.
* **Top Source Countries:** A table ranking the most frequent source countries based on event volume.

### 2. Authentication Monitoring üõ°Ô∏è
This dashboard is centered on monitoring authentication attempts, especially failures, to detect brute-force attacks and other access-related threats.

* **Country ‚Üí IP drill-down:** A hierarchical table grouping failed SSH login attempts first by country and then by source IP, allowing for drill-down analysis of geographic hotspots.
* **Failed login attempts by Source IP:** Displays the source IPs with the highest number of SSH authentication failures, quickly identifying the origins of brute-force attacks.
* **Geographic distribution of SSH failures:** A world map showing the geographic distribution of failed SSH login attempts to identify if attacks are globally distributed or regionally concentrated.
* **Top targeted usernames:** Lists the most frequently targeted usernames in failed authentication attempts, which helps identify common accounts under attack.
* **Brute-force activity over time (by Source IP):** A line chart that plots failed logins over time, broken down by source IP, to detect attack patterns like fast brute-force bursts or slow, persistent attempts.

### 3. Sentinel SOC Overview üìä
This is a high-level dashboard for a Security Operations Center (SOC), designed to provide a quick, at-a-glance overview of the current security posture based on alerts and events.

* **Total Events (KPI):** Displays a total count of all security events logged within the selected time frame. It serves as a key indicator of the overall activity volume.
* **Top Source Countries:** A table listing the top 10 countries originating the most security events, helping to quickly identify the most active geographic regions.
* **Map of IPs:** A world map that color-codes countries based on the volume of security events originating from them. It provides an immediate visual of geographic hotspots.
* **Alert Severity:** A pie chart showing the proportion of alerts generated by each monitored agent or system. It helps to understand which sources are producing the most alerts.
* **Timeline Events:** A line chart that plots the number of security events over time, with separate lines for the top 3 agents. It's ideal for visualizing trends and activity spikes.
* **Top Source IPs:** A bar chart showing the top 10 source IP addresses generating the most events, making it easy to identify the 'noisiest' or potentially malicious systems.
* **Recent Events:** A table that lists the most recent events, including their timestamp and country of origin, for a quick analysis of current activity.

### 4. Threat Intelligence Overview ü¶†
This dashboard focuses on threat intelligence, primarily leveraging its **VirusTotal** integration to analyze file reputation and detect malware.

* **VirusTotal Summary:** A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) card that shows the total number of files scanned by VirusTotal, providing a high-level count of analysis operations.
* **Clean vs Malicious:** A donut chart that compares the percentage of scanned files classified as malicious versus those deemed clean. It offers a visual summary of the overall file reputation status.
* **Recent Threat Detections:** A detailed table listing the most recent files detected as malicious by VirusTotal. It includes the file path, the number of positive detections (`positives`), and the total number of engines used in the scan (`total`).
* **Detection Timeline:** An area chart that displays the number of VirusTotal detections over time, separating events for malicious and non-malicious files. It helps identify trends or spikes in threat detections.
* **Top File Paths Under Scan:** A horizontal bar chart showing the top 10 file paths most frequently scanned by the file integrity monitor (syscheck), which can indicate areas of high activity or attacker interest.
* **Detection Score Distribution:** A bar chart that shows how many files received a certain 'positives' score from VirusTotal (e.g., how many files were flagged by 1 engine, 2 engines, etc.). This helps gauge the confidence level of a detection.
