### Production Security Pipeline

```
Endpoints (Sysmon) → Wazuh Agent
                        ↓
Wazuh Manager (Secured TLS)
  ├─ Detection Rules → Alerts (JSON)
  ├─ VirusTotal Integration (FIM)
  └─ GeoIP Enrichment
                        ↓
Wazuh Indexer (OpenSearch - Secured)
                        ↓
Wazuh Dashboard (HTTPS - Production Ready)
```

### Parallel ELK Analytics Pipeline

```
Wazuh Manager → Filebeat (TLS Secured)
                    ↓
