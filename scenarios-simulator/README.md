# üõ°Ô∏è Sentinel SOC - Scenario Simulators

This directory contains a suite of **Bash scripts** designed to generate realistic security event logs for the **Sentinel SOC** environment. These simulators help test the entire data pipeline, from log generation and collection by **Wazuh** to analysis, alerting, and visualization in the SOC dashboards.

**Key Objective:** Populate the SOC dashboards with meaningful data for training, demonstration, and validation of the monitoring and detection rules.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** All scripts must be executed **inside the wazuh-manager Docker container** to ensure they can write to the correct log files monitored by Wazuh.

## 1. üîê SSH Authentication Simulator

**File:** `ssh-auth/ssh-auth-simulator.sh`

This script simulates a variety of **SSH authentication failure events**, which are common indicators of brute-force attacks or unauthorized access attempts. The logs are written in a standard format compatible with `/var/log/auth.log`.

### Features

* Generates logs for failed passwords, invalid users, and connection resets.
* Uses a curated list of international IP addresses to test **GeoIP functionality**.
* Simulates attack patterns: **fast/slow brute-force, credential spraying, targeted attacks**.
* Populates the **"Authentication"** and **"SOC Overview"** dashboards.

### How to Use

**Copy the script to the container:**

```bash
docker cp ./scenarios-simulator/ssh-auth/ssh-auth-simulator.sh sentinel-wazuh-manager:/usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator.sh
```

**Make it executable:**

```bash
docker exec sentinel-wazuh-manager chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator.sh
```

**Run the simulation:**

```bash
docker exec sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator.sh [OPTIONS]
```

### Example Usage

* Generate 50 mixed SSH failure events:

```bash
docker exec sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator.sh -n 50 -p mixed
```

* Simulate a fast brute-force attack from a single IP:

```bash
docker exec sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/ssh-auth-simulator.sh -n 25 -p fast_brute -v
```

## 2. üåê Network Activity Simulator

**File:** `network/network-activity-simulator.sh`

This script generates **iptables-style firewall drop logs**, essential for testing network security monitoring rules, including **port scan detection**.

### Features

* Simulates TCP and UDP connections dropped by a firewall.
* Uses international IPs to populate the **GeoIP world map**.
* Includes patterns for **single\_flow**, **portscan\_fast**, and **portscan\_slow** attacks.
* Populates the **"Network"** and **"SOC Overview"** dashboards.

### How to Use

**Copy the script to the container:**

```bash
docker cp ./scenarios-simulator/network/network-activity-simulator.sh sentinel-wazuh-manager:/usr/local/bin/network-activity-simulator.sh
```

**Make it executable:**

```bash
docker exec sentinel-wazuh-manager chmod +x /usr/local/bin/network-activity-simulator.sh
```

**Run the simulation:**

```bash
docker exec sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/network-activity-simulator.sh [OPTIONS]
```

### Example Usage

* Generate 30 mixed firewall drop events:

```bash
docker exec sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/network-activity-simulator.sh -n 30 -p mixed
```

* Simulate a fast port scan to trigger correlation rules:

```bash
docker exec sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/network-activity-simulator.sh -p portscan_fast
```

## 3. ü¶† Malware Drop Simulator

**File:** `malware-drop/malware-drop-simulator.sh`

This script tests the **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)** capabilities of Wazuh (`syscheck`) and the **VirusTotal integration**.

### Features

* Creates files in a directory monitored by Wazuh FIM (`/var/ossec/data/fimtest`).
* Generates FIM alerts for *"file added"*.
* Triggers the **VirusTotal integration**, scanning the hash of new files.
* Generates high-severity alerts when an **EICAR test file** (simulated malware) is detected.
* Populates the **"Threat Intelligence"** and **"FIM"** dashboards.

### How to Use

**Copy the script to the container:**

```bash
docker cp ./scenarios-simulator/malware-drop/malware-drop-simulator.sh sentinel-wazuh-manager:/usr/local/bin/malware-drop-simulator.sh
```

**Make it executable:**

```bash
docker exec sentinel-wazuh-manager chmod +x /usr/local/bin/malware-drop-simulator.sh
```

**Run the simulation (arguments: \[number\_of\_files] \[malicious\_ratio]):**

```bash
docker exec sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/malware-drop-simulator.sh 10 3
```

### Example Usage

* Create 10 files, where approximately 1 in 3 is malicious:

```bash
docker exec sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/malware-drop-simulator.sh 10 3
```

* Create 20 files, with a 1 in 5 chance of being malicious:

```bash
docker exec sentinel-wazuh-manager /usr/local/bin/malware-drop-simulator.sh 20 5
```

* Clean up the created files after a simulation:

```bash
docker exec sentinel-wazuh-manager rm -f /var/ossec/data/fimtest/*
```
